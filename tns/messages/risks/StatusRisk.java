/**
 * The status risk models the fact that the terrorist agents have a certain 
 * stature within the organization and that their time is valuable.  Therefore, 
 * if an influential logistician receives a request from some second-rate leader
 * looking for some fake passports, he is probably going to turn him down 
 * because the leader is beneath him, but if he receives a call from Pablo 
 * Escobar looking for the same thing, he's probably going to accommodate him. 
 * To place the status risk on par with mission draw for the purpose of 
 * processing the "get resource" message as described below, this risk is based 
 * on the product of the specialistï¿½s influence and experience.

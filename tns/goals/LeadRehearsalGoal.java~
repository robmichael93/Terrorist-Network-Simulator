/**
 * The lead mission rehearsal goal gives the leader the behavior that once the 
 * preponderance of the resources for the mission have been obtained, all the

 * setup the necessary training facilities for him, the leader can take his cell
 * and run them through the mission for the required period of time.  Once the 
 * rehearsal finishes, the leader can return to gathering any remaining 
 * resources before launching off into the mission.

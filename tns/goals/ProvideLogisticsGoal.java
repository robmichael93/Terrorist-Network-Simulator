/**
 * This goal encodes the behavior that the specialist has a cache of resources 
 * either at hand or on call that he has standing by for a leader to request.  
 * Another behavior created by this goal is that a specialist has a minimum 
 * amount below which he will not provide the resource and instead return to 
 * restocking that resource.  In evaluating this goal, the specialist examines
 * if a leader requested resources during the last turn via messaging.  If so, 
 * then an additional weight is given to this goal, described below as well.

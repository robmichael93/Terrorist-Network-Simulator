/**
 * The first of three specialist roles, the financier provides the 
 * ever-essential component for any operation, money.  In the specialist roles, 
 * the agent’s experience drives their ability to produce their particular 
 * resource and their influence controls how much resource; therefore 
 * specialists represent a range of individuals in this class.  Financiers with 
 * a low experience and influence model individuals only capable of knocking
 * over some convenience stores or conducting credit card fraud to grab a 
 * relatively small amount of money.  Experienced and influential financiers on 
 * the hand are like bankers who know how to move large amounts of money 
 * discreetly, or oil sheiks who want to support the organization while at the 
 * same time appearing impartial, or individuals with “old money” that donate to 
 * the cause.

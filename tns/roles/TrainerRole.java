/**
 * Trainers model those individuals in the organization who are good at what 
 * they do as far as the ins and outs of mission operations.  As such, these 
 * trainers are ideal for passing that knowledge down to young recruits. 
 * Trainers are like career Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) in militaries 
 * today, people who've "been around the block" and are looking to share that
 * wisdom with raw recruits.  Trainers also sit at the top of one track of 
 * advancement for individuals in the organization.  Those individuals who 
 * either do not become promoted by a leader to a specialist role and continue 
 * to gain experience and influence through carrying out missions, or become 
 * disavowed by the organization, convert into trainers and do not advance to
 * any other role beyond the trainer.

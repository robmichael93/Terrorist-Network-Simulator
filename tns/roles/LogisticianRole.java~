/**
 * The second of the specialist roles, the logistician provides the organization
 * the ways and means necessary to carry out mission.  Logisticians provide
 * among other things, transportation such as vehicles and planes, obtain
 * passports and the like, coordinate safe-houses, and setup communications such 
 * as obtaining encrypted satellite phones.  Inexperienced logisticians probably
 * make fake passports out of their own house, hotwire cars for transportation, 
 * and buy cell phones from a local retailer, while their more experience 
 * brethren know whom to call to forge a visa, how to obtain stolen cars with
 * fake license plates, and how to sanitize and fence stolen goods for the
 * organization, while the really influential types have access to large-scale 
 * commercial and military transportation to include ocean-going vessels and 
 * might even own a transportation company or an import/export company, or maybe
 * even work in a consulate or passport office (or at least know someone who 
 * does and is willing to help out).

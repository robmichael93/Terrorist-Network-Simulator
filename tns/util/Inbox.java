/**
 * Each agent has an inbox that other agent’s can place messages in.  At the 
 * start of any agent’s turn, that agent will process the messages in his inbox. 
 * The agent first checks the target role to see if it matches one of his roles. 
 * If it does not, then he places the message in his outbox to be forwarded on. 
 * If the agent has a role that matches the target role, then the agent 
 * evaluates the benefits and risks of answering the message.  If the benefits 
 * exceed the risks, then the agent takes the action specified in the message’s 
 * content, which is in the form of a ticket.  The last action an agent takes 
 * in answering a message is to look at the message’s forwarding chain and if 
 * any of the agents or links between them are missing from the agent’s mental 
 * map he adds those nodes and links.  As each message is examined it is removed
 * from the agent’s inbox.

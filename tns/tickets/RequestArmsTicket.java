/**
 * The tickets for requesting resources (the leader has one for each type of 
 * resource the specialists provide) increments the leader's stuck counter for 
 * requesting resources.  If the leader does not have all the operators needed 
 * for a mission, the stuck counter for getting operators is incremented as 
 * well.  The reason for incrementing the counter for getting operators is if
 * the leader is just starting out and his goal for getting operators has a low 
 * weight, but the leader does not know any specialists, he'll never satisfy his
 * request resource goals and the leader will remain stuck on those goals.  
 * Therefore, by incrementing the counter for getting operators allows the 
 * leader to find a source of operators and the leader can promote operators to 
 * specialists, therefore the leader can grow a network.  The other counter is 
 * used to model the leader's impatience with waiting for a specialist to 
 * provide a resource or for the leader to get in touch with a specialist that 
 * has a needed resource.  This counter is used to weight the "convert an 
 * operator to a specialist" goal, which in turn allows the leader to turn an 
 * operator into the needed specialist and the leader can progress along on the
 * mission, albeit at probably a slower rate since the newly converted 
 * specialist will likely been unskilled.  This type of ticket is also 
 * interruptible.  The leader extends a connector specific to the type of 
 * resource requested and if a corresponding specialist hears the connector, 
 * then the ticket is interrupted, preventing the get resource message from 
 * being placed in the leader's outbox.

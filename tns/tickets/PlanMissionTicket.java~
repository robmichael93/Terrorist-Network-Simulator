/**
 *  This ticket creates a new target and a new mission for the leader.  This 
 * ticket is unique in that it is scheduled via a discrete event simulation 
 * mechanism discussed below so that the ticket actually takes place some number 
 * of turns later and the leader “blocks” on the plan mission goal, much the same
 * way network sockets block until they connect, until the leader creates a 
 * target and mission.  The purpose for this design decision was to allow
 * operators attached to a leader that just completed a mission the ability to
 * become mobile and potentially migrate to another leader.  If the leader did 
 * not take more than one turn to create a target and mission, the leader would 
 * always have the same operators in his missions and other leaders in the 
 * system might starve on the need for operators.  By allowing operators to
 * migrate between leaders, the system as a whole can progress further on 
 * accomplishing missions.  When the leader finishes planning a mission the 
 * “plan a mission” goal is marked complete.

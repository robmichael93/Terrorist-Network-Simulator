/**
 * When a specialist hears a connector from a leader requesting a resource, the 
 * specialist looks at his current level of resource before trying to provide 
 * the resource.  The specialist provides resources to the leader up to either 
 * the amount requested by the leader or the amount the specialist has on hand, 
 * which ever is smaller.  The specialist then receives either a point of 
 * experience or influence for every point of resource that was exchanged.  The
 * specialist then sets a Boolean latch that indicates that the specialist
 * provided resources during the turn.  This latch is used in the evaluation of 
 * the produce a resource goal.
